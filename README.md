NOTES
Towards the end of coding, I went to push my code to GitHub and recieved  a fatal error in my terminal. My 'index.html' said it was deleted. I went to look at my GitHub and it said I had not commited any code. I do not understand what happened. So, I copy and pasted in my code into another file and then recloned this assignment down.
